                Scientists have discovered narrowing your eyes is the best way to build a rapport with cats.</li>
            <li><span style="color:rgb(8, 10, 143);"><b>Cats can tell when a thunderstorm is coming</b></span><br> Cats
                and many other animals are more sensitive than humans to sounds, smells and changes in atmospheric
                pressure, and their heightened senses can allow them to pick up hints that a storm is coming well before
                their owners catch wind of it. </li>
            <li><span style="color:rgb(8, 10, 143);"><b>Cats like boxes because they’re cosy</b></span> <br> Cats can
                spend 18 hours a day sleeping. As they are solitary animals, they want a safe hiding place to snooze.
            </li>
            <li><span style="color:rgb(8, 10, 143);"><b>Pet cats have an enormous impact on local wildlife</b></span>
                <br> According to a study from March 2020, hunting by pets can have a big effect on the local wildlife
                population. Scientists say the effect is mostly concentrated around a cat’s home, as most of their
                movement is within a 100m radius. This usually encompasses a few gardens on either side.</li>
            <li><span style="color:rgb(8, 10, 143);"><b>Cats’ whiskers make them precision killers</b></span><br> A
                cat’s characteristic ‘moustache’ of vibrissae, made up of 24 or so mobile hairs, is accompanied by other
                less apparent whiskers above the eyes, on the chin and the back of the front paws (the carpal whiskers).
                These thickened hairs are alive with deep-rooted nerves that help our feline friends literally feel
                their way through a hunt, especially in the dark.</li>
