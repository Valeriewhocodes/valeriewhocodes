                    Scientists have discovered narrowing your eyes is the best way to build a rapport with cats.</li>

                    Cats
                    and many other animals are more sensitive than humans to sounds, smells and changes in atmospheric
                    pressure, and their heightened senses can allow them to pick up hints that a storm is coming well
                    before
                    their owners catch wind of it. </li>
                <li><span style="color:rgb(8, 10, 143);"><b>Cats like boxes because they’re cosy</b></span> <br> Cats
                    can
                    spend 18 hours a day sleeping. As they are solitary animals, they want a safe hiding place to
                    snooze.
                </li>
                <li><span style="color:rgb(8, 10, 143);"><b>Pet cats have an enormous impact on local
                            wildlife</b></span>
                    <br> According to a study from March 2020, hunting by pets can have a big effect on the local
                    wildlife
                    population. Scientists say the effect is mostly concentrated around a cat’s home, as most of their
                    movement is within a 100m radius. This usually encompasses a few gardens on either side.</li>
                <li><span style="color:rgb(8, 10, 143);"><b>Cats’ whiskers make them precision killers</b></span><br> A
                    cat’s characteristic ‘moustache’ of vibrissae, made up of 24 or so mobile hairs, is accompanied by
                    other
                    less apparent whiskers above the eyes, on the chin and the back of the front paws (the carpal
                    whiskers).
                    These thickened hairs are alive with deep-rooted nerves that help our feline friends literally feel
                    their way through a hunt, especially in the dark.</li>
